//! Viewport filter trait for post-processing rendered frames.
//!
//! Plugins that implement [`ViewportFilter`] can transform the viewport image
//! after the main render pipeline (tile compositing, adjustments, stain norm)
//! has produced a frame. Filters are applied in registration order.
//!
//! Two rendering paths are supported:
//!
//! - **CPU**: The filter receives and returns an RGBA8 pixel buffer.
//! - **GPU**: The filter receives raw Vulkan handles for zero-copy access
//!   to GPU memory. In-process (FFI) plugins get the VkDevice and VkImage
//!   directly; out-of-process (gRPC) plugins receive a DMA-BUF file
//!   descriptor passed over a Unix domain socket.
//!
//! In-process Rust plugins implement this trait directly via `abi_stable`.
//! Out-of-process plugins (Python, etc.) use the gRPC `ExtensionHost` service,
//! where the host acts as a bridge between the render pipeline and the remote
//! filter.
